In the GameObject HologramCollection/ControlsUI/menu/rooms/interactions there is a group of gameobjects that activate the interactions that are described in interactions.md.

These scripts are all fairly simplistic but they each behave slightly differently based on the nature of the interaction. There are a few cases where behaviour could be consolidated into a single script but I don't see this a necessary right now.
