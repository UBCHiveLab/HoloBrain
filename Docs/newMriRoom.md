changing fxnality of stuff we have:
user clicks on two options in menu to switch between axial and coronal overlays
	- this makes the appropriate set of rings appear on the brain

clicking on a ring makes that mri appear and triggers the clip animation


new features:
a wall appears with all the mris, and the ones available are highlighted
(can use two wall, each corresponding to the appropriate mri set)

how to highlight the right mri on the wall when clicked in the ring?
